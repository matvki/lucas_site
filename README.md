# Lucas's site

It's a site for a graphic designer who want an horizontal design.

## What's in ?

There is a night mode in php and a language selector in php too.
There is a script in js for the horizontal scroll but it will work too with a pad.
There is some clip in one of the project.

## To Do

[ ] make more animation
[ ] patch headband for everyone
[ ] make the night and language mode in js not only in php (maybe not sure because it works prety well in php)
[ ] patch the loading time (maybe picture size ?)
[ ] do a contact form
